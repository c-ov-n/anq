## A Beginning

[quote,Mass of the Dead God]
____
In the beginning the world was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And Chaos moved upon the face of the waters.

### Negative Existence

Existence happens because non-existence is unstable.

The nature of non-existence can be understood in three steps.
Nothingness means no-thing-ness.
“No”, negation, is the key to understanding.
The nature of Nothing can only be approached by stripping away all concept of what it is.
Nothing is not anything, nor is it void, nor is it not void.
Following this spiral of negation we approach an understanding that nothing is in no way limited.
The nature of pure non-being is identical with all being, even all contradiction, asserting itself into being simultaneously.

### Primal Chaos

The principle of the instability of non-being is primal Chaos.
This is the divine spark of creation, the light that flashes out of void and defines the void in its light.
Its spark may immediately flash and go out, or it may take such a form that it gives rise to the next step.
