## Introduction

Magick is the art that weaves the fabric of reality.footnote:[We choose to use the spelling "magick" in the tradition of Aliester Crowley to differentiate from works of illusion.]
There are many systems of magick, many paradigms.
What makes each worthy of being called "magick" is the aim to manifest results beyond natural means.
A comptent magickian must have some knowledge and skill of natural technologies, but the study of magick aims to move beyond the natural, to the super-natural, to miracules.
This brings us immediately to the fundamental paradox of magick:
How can magick be possible if at the core magick is the aims to manifest by impossible means?

One common response to this paradox is to determine that this definition of magick is an absurd self-contridution and worth no further time or consideration.
For many, this is the end of the matter.
For others, those who do practice magick side step this paradox, saying that magick is entirely natural.
When apparently miraculous things occur as the result of some magick work it has obeyed some natural law simply not fully expressed or yet understood.
Also, of course, many do just fine without any fundamental theory.
They just _do_ magick and get results and spend no time or concern about deeper questions of the possible and impossible.

This current work is the result of an obsession in exploring the paradox of magick.
The fundamental theory we put forth in this work is that magick only seems to be a paradox when we misunderstand reality and possibility.
Magick is the art that weaves the fabric of reality.
Magick never has been something that is real or unreal, possible or impossible, because magick is not any of these things.
Magick is no-thing.

We will endevor to trace the thread of magick from non-being to manifest reality and beyond, to show how no-thing, non-being, makes everything manifest, carrying its incompleteness with it at every step.

### What is ANQ?

This book introduces the concepts and practices of working with the ANQ meta-magick system.
This is an open system with a structure inspired by Qabalah/Kabbalah, but with no intent to be an interpretation of such systems.

ANQ stands for ANQ's Not Qabalah, a nod to the https://gnu.org/[GNU project], "GNU's Not Unix".
The GNU project emerged in response to the ownership claims to the popular Unix operating system.
Like GNU, ANQ aims to create a free and open structure that can be built upon and manipulated in whatever manner the user desires.
ANQ is a meta-magick system that, like an operating system, aims to give you what you need to get your own customized magick environment up and running faster with a minimum of constraints placed on what you create on top of it.

The core of the ANQ system is the emergence of the Process Tree.
The first seeds of this work were planted in 1998.
When studying the Qabalah and the Tarot as presented by Aleister Crowley, the mind rejected it.
There was seen a brilliance obscured by too many obscurities, overburdened with syncretic associations.
It was clear that the best way forward to study the Qabalah was to not study the Qabalah, but rather water this minimal brilliant seed and see how it developed of its own accord.

Any true student of this work must likewise work with this system and come to their own understanding of it.
There are brilliant flashes of insight throughout its structure.
The only way to pluck this fruit is to make it your own.
Hesitate not at all to reject or reform any aspect or correspondence.
My own experience has taught me that there are many alternate forms of this emergent structure, each of which may be of use and have its own hidden treasure.
What is presented here is what has been found in my own exploration to be the most useful configuration.

The word “Qabalah” is used due to the obvious debt this system owes to other systems of Qabalah, particularly the Hermetic Qabalah and Aleister Crowley’s work in particular.
However, this system and its emergent method mark a deliberate break with traditional Qabalah.
We have no regard for whether the system presented here either elucidates the meaning of any other system of Qabalah or contradicts it.
The lack of correspondences such as the Hebrew alphabet and astrological associations are deliberate.
Practitioners are invited to add these, or other correspondences into the system or not as they find useful.
