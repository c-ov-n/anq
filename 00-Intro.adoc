## Introduction

This book introduces the concepts and practices of working with the ANQ meta-magick system.
This is an open system with a structure inspired by Qabalah/Kabbalah, but with no intent to be an interpretation of such systems.

ANQ stands for ANQ's Not Qabalah, a nod to the https://gnu.org/[GNU project], "GNU's Not Unix".
The GNU project emerged in response to the ownership claims to the popular Unix operating system.
Like GNU, ANQ aims to create a free and open structure that can be built upon and manipulated in whatever manner the user desires.
ANQ is a meta-magick system that, like an operating system, aims to give you what you need to get your own customized magick environment up and running faster with a minimum of constraints placed on what you create on top of it.
