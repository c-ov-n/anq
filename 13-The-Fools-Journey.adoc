## The Fool's Journey

### 0 - The Fool

(1) Chaos -> (2) Process

### I - The Magus

(2) Process -> (3) Pattern

This path is the Empress in the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems.

### II - The Spinner

(3) Pattern -> (1) Chaos

In the Thoth this path is the Magus and The Magician in the G∴D∴ system.

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems trump II is the High Priestess and in the Tarot of Marseilles it is La Papesse (The Popess).

### III - The Serpent

(1) Chaos -> (6/11) Agent

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems this path is The High Priestess.

### IV - The Emperor

(6/11) Agent -> (4/5) Intent

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems this path is The Hermit.

### V - The Hierophant

(4/5) Intent -> (2) Process

This path is also the Hierophant in the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems.

### VI - The Lovers

(2) Process -> (6/11) Agent

The corresponding path in the Thoth tarot is the Star and The Emperor in the G∴D∴ system.

### VII - Chariot

(6/11) Agent -> (5/7) Will

The corresponding path in the Thoth is Adjustment and Justice in the G∴D∴ system.

### VIII - Justice

(5/7) Will -> (3) Pattern

### IX - Hermit

(3) Pattern -> (6/11) Agent

### X - Fortune

(6/11) Agent -> (7/13) Sense

### XI - Strength

(7/13) Sense -> (4/5) Intent

One interpretation is strength as in signal strength.
Sense data connecting to the fundamental things of being.
Another spin on it, relating to the traditional symbol of the card of the woman with the lion, it is seeing things truely.
Strength is knowing what not to fear, because when our sense lets us read intent we know when we are safe and when there is real danger.

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems the corresponding path is Fortune.
The Thoth calls trump XI "Lust" but for ANQ Lust is trump XII.

### XII - Hanged Man

(4/5) Intent -> (5/7) Will

This path emerged from the descent of fire in the formation of the pentagram.
This was the transformation of the divine fire of creation to take on destructive properties.
So the various myths of the descent of fire apply to this path.
The myth of prometheus, and his being bound to a rock is punishment echo the binding of the hanged man.
Also significant is the myth of Odin and the runes, his binding to the world tree.

In the Thoth this path is called Lust and in Strength in the G∴D∴ system.

### XIII - Death

(5/7) Will -> (8/17) Thought

Sphere (5/7) relates to the passage of time and to (8/17) memory, symbolic thougth.
Death in this context is about memory in time, aging, and memory of things past and lost.
Memory cuts both ways, the ability to understand death and loss is because of memory, but memory is also how we exist through time.

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems the corresponding path is Hanged Man.

### XIV - Art

(8/17) Thought -> (6/11) Agent

The meaning of this path is to do with how we manipulate symbols and are shaped by them.
In the lunar cycle this path is also at the full moon, marking the halfway point in the fool's journey.
As Art this is a turning point.
Up to this point the forces have been shaping the agent, now the agent fully shifts to an active, creative role in the meanings of the subsequent paths.

Traditionally the title of this card number is Temperance though ANQ follows renaming the path to Art.
In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems the corresponding path on the tree is the The Devil in the ANQ system the paths of Art and the Devil are swapped.

### XV - Devil

(6/11) Agent -> (9/19) Desire

The 9th sphere as desire is the about how we build on thought to now be driven emotionally by things of thought rather than direct experience, this is attachment to the world which binds us to manifestation. The Devil is this path of binding through desire.
This is not objectively a good or bad thing, but in the traditional rendering of this card we see the devil and humans shackled, bound by their sinfulness etc
My take on it is that this desire is about our willingness to enter into life and play the hand we have been dealt
buy the ticket, take the ride
To embrace this desire is to say yes to life and all the drama that comes with it

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems this path is Art/Temperance, the interpretation of the 9th sphere is also a departure in ANQ, desire/foundation

### XVI - The Tower

(9/19) Desire -> (7/13) Sense

This is the connection between sense and desire. It is the jolt that accompanies a sense that triggers desire or aversion. It is how an object of desire stands out. It is how our thoughts is derailed by a sudden trigger for desire.
If we stop here, this would be the interpretation of this path in the 9th tree, but the emergence continues into manifestation. The ancestry of this path is that it split off X - Fortune and splitting from XVI - Tower is XX - Judgement as desire begets manifestation. This brings desire into a context of manifestation. In Judgement we have the satisfaction of desire, or not, at least a resolution. Tower remains specifically as desire unsatisfied. It also may be desire that compels one to act in a way that will run into disaster in reality.
This path differs from XV - Devil in that in the XVI - Tower desire is experienced, but it is not inevitable that this desire will bind us, and, while the desires of the Tower are striking and bring something to consciousness, the desire of the Devil are part of us and more unconscious in nature
The tower is experiencing something and it exciting us. The devil is the excitement itself, sometimes which we find overtaking us but we can't identify where it came from except from our own nature.

In the Thoth this path is Emperor, in the G∴D∴ system this is path the Star

### XVII - The Star

(7/13) Sense -> (8/17) Thought

The Star is the flow of information as sense data crystallizes into thought and memory.
The star may be thought of as a seed crystal.
Each new bit of information is linked into the growing matrix... though this card may also represent the opposite, a dissolution of thought, things dislodged, forgotten, buried. Cognitive theory is relevant as are processes identified such as deletion, distortion, and generalization. By these mechanisms sense data is transformed to be present (or absent) from thought.
This makes the path of the star also extremely relevant for access to the subconscious, because of its role in editing the raw data. This has been called the psychic censor.

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems this path is the Tower

### XVIII - Moon

(8/17) Thought -> (9/19) Desire

The eighth sphere has thought, language, and symbol while the ninth is fear and desire.
In this path that links them we have dreams, myths, and archetypes.
This is the way of symbols that move us in the deepest ways.
In dreams these symbols are most pronounced, where they are free to draw outside line lines of sensible narrative.
Depths are also a key to this card and symbols of water is apt for the subconscious.
The eighth sphere is thought, but it is not rationality.
Rationality is only a surface phenomena.
In this path desire is like the treasure that slips out of hand into these depths, enticing you to dive in after it.
These themes continue in the path XXV where it becomes The Labyrinth.

The Thoth and G∴D∴ systems call this path The Sun.

### XIX - Sun

(9/19) Desire -> (10/23) Object

The Sun is desire opening a channel to manifestation.
It is a breaking through solipsism, we will ourselves to be in a world that is beyond our control because only in such a world, a world that is more than us, can our desires truly find gratification.
It is the uncertainty of the objective world, the world beyond our control, that makes this possible.
This path is the gateway into that world, though as we step into it we become finite, we become small as we become real.
We are like a god that has made a stone so large that we cannot lift it.

The Thoth calls this path The Universe and G∴D∴ systems call this path The World, but we're at the end of where these correspondences should be expected to provide much of a hit about the meaning of the path, because the tenth sphere has split into subject and object and so has the corresponding path split off path XXIII.

### XX - Judgement

(10/23) Object -> (7/17) Sense

The meaning of XX - Judgement is derived from sense of an object.
This is not the judgement of Judgement Day, it is simply, our judgement comes from experience.
Everything that we know about the world comes from sense.
We know that our sense is also not the thing itself.
We know that color as we experience is not an inherent property of the things which appeared with color to us, but the direct experience is the closest we get.

In the Thoth and G∴D∴ systems this path is the Moon.
The Thoth tarot calls this path the Aeon, but for ANQ this will appear as trump XXV.

### XXI - Universe

(7/13) Sense -> (12/31)

In ANQ the Universe means something quite different.
The universe is flow of data itself that arrives through sense, the experience of having experience, Qualia.
To experience the universe how it is requires dropping all concept of what the universe is and instead just experiencing.
As this is experience of experience, it is also transcendental consciousness, consciousness that transcends that which is conscious of.
This is consciousness without any sort of judgement
Some call this a flow state, but it isn't clear if everyone means the same thing by flow.
The state can be identified by a sort of detachment with perfect clarity
It may seem odd that the World or Universe is not connected to the sphere of objectivity... this is because ultimately what is "real" is neither subjective nor objective.

Trump XXI is Universe in Thoth and World traditionally.

This path has no correspondence in other systems, though the path splits off of XVI - Tower.

### XXII - Lust

(12/31) -> (9/19) Desire

This path is the highest form of desire, desire for all things, all experience, for desire itself.
This is yes to life, to all things.
This is the path of Babylon, the scarlet woman, the great whore, the mother of abominations, etc.
The Thoth tarot associated this meaning with Strength, but ANQ preserves more of the original meaning for that card and places Lust here.
Note that the cross path and complement for Lust is XXVII The Acéphale, the headless one.
In relation between these two paths, [http://lib.oto-usa.org/libri/liber0156.html Liber Chet] is appropriate.

This path in the ANQ tree or card number has no correspondence in other systems.

### XXIII - Rebellion

(9/19) Desire -> (11/29) Subject

The essence of this path is what Austin Osman Spare called Self-Love.
It is the desire to be oneself with whatever constraints that entails or whatever ensues.
It is the existential concept of being authentically oneself.
This does not necessarily mean rebellion, but in the rebel we see most clearly the expression of oneself.
Rebel, misfit, freak, many that embrace simply being themselves end up wearing these labels or even taking them for themselves.
There is a notion of God that says that the mind of God holds and sustains all things.
If we reject God we find ourselves cut off from any plan or purpose.
Self-love welcomes this state as essential.
To truly be ourselves we run towards this fate.

### XXIV - The Labyrinth

### XXV - The Aeon

### XXVI - Shadows

### XXVII - The Acéphale

### XXVIII - The Cavern
