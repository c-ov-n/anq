## Descent of Fire

So far the process of manifestation describes only abstract static concepts.
Because the emergence of intent in the previous step exists within a larger pattern there is now the possibility for these intents to be in conflict.
These things can be created and destroyed.

Think of a game like chess.
First, the game consists of a set of rules, the pattern which constrains the game.
Within the game the board starts a pre-determined configuration, with each piece able to move upon the board and take other pieces.
The pieces of the game are clearly individual units that can be destroyed or removed depending on how the game proceeds.
The removal of a piece does not break the game, it is part of the game.
It is this principle, that things can change, creating and destroying that is the next principle.

In the fifth step there is also an echo of the second.
We return to process, returning to incompleteness, but in the second step the process is always building, it is now at the next level and can be destructive at this level.

If the process of creation will now continue in this level, creation must necessitate destruction.
This is simply the same process as before, chaos sparking creation into the world, but now it is disruptive to what was there previously.
This is the fundamental nature of the force of Will, though it has not yet attached itself to an agent.

This fifth sphere emerges by splitting from fourth.
The path marked “6″ splits from “3″ along with it.
A new symmetry of sums appears: 9 = 6+3 = 2+7 = 4+5.

If we twist the bottom of the fifth step of the process tree we find it corresponds to the classic elemental configuration of the pentagram:

### Reinterpreting the Elemental Pentagram

The pentagram is just a five pointed star.
If it appears in a circle then it can be called a pentacle.
It can be aligned with a central point upward or downward or to the side, whatever suits.
Fundamentally the pentagram is just a beautiful geometric shape to which meanings can be associated.

There is a traditional set of pentagrams that map the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth to the four lower points and spirit to the topmost point.

### ANQ Pentagram Ritual

The ANQ pentagram ritual follows in a pattern established by the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, LRP, also known as the Lesser _Banishing_ Ritual of the Pentagram, LBRP,
but with the simplifications used in Peter Carrol's Gnostic Pentagram ritual.

The direct pentagram invoking and banishing patterns are understood as a result of the emergence of the position of the five elements from the four through the descent of fire discussed previously.

In brief, Water and Air make a syzygy, a complementary/opposite pair: process and pattern, the process being the essential incompleteness of existence that yields the flow of creation and its complement of the universal pattern produced by the flow of process.
Fire and Earth are also a syzygy.
Fire originally being the divine spark of chaos which asserts itself into being from non-being and Earth being the emergent phenomena which arises within process and pattern, Intent.
In the fifth step fire has descended and now its creative force is also destructive.
The creation/destruction of Fire is Will.
Divine reasonless-ness of chaos is spirit and creation/destruction is fire.
The path between the top point and fire and earth still represents the syzygy, even though it is now split.

When invoking the path should be drawn with a total of six strokes.
Begin as indicated below, moving along the path toward the element, tracing out the pentagram and ending by repeating the first path to end on element invoked.
In banishing we use five strokes, we reverse the initial direction and stop upon returning to the element, returning it to its proper place.
Banishing is balanced, the fifth stroke brings completion. Invoking is intentionally not balanced.
